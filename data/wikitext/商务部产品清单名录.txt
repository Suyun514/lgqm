经过google和wiki，发现没有人做过纯瓷器的浴缸，古代的浴缸是用铜，大理石，木材做的。最早的现代浴缸是在19世纪中期，制作的铸铁浴缸，光滑的表面是搪瓷制品效果，可能这让很多非专业人士以为这次瓷器。毕竟纯瓷器的浴缸，那份量可是杠杠的，贮满水后，肯定超过梅晚的竹筋水泥楼板的静态荷载。但是我还是准备画一个古典的浴缸，并且带有青花瓷纹样，安慰工业党人的美好愿望。如下是摘抄的原文：

<big>'''A Brief History of Bathing in General and the Clawfoot Bathtub'''</big>

The earliest plumbing systems ever discovered date back nearly 6000 years to the Indus River Valley in India where copper water pipes were excavated from the ruins of a palace. Fast forward 3000 years to the island of Crete where the ancestor of a pedestal tub was unearthed – five feet long, made of hard pottery, its shape resembling the 19th century clawfoot tub.

The Roman Empire from 500 BC through AD 455 championed the daily ritual of bathing and raised the bar for acceptable sanitation. They used lead and bronze pipes, marble fixtures, and created a comprehensive sewerage system. During this period, public baths were most common, and private baths resembled indoor pools usually encompassing an entire room.

After the collapse of the Roman Empire and descent into the Dark Ages, sanitation virtually disappeared. Bathing was replaced by the use of perfume. Waste was thrown out into streets or emptied directly into rivers that also served as the drinking water supply. In fact, the slang term for toilet, loo, is reported to have derived from the practice of the French yelling out the warning, “Gardez l'eau!” (pronounced gardy loo – meaning “mind the water”), before emptying the chamber pot from an upper level onto the street below.

Following the devastation of the Bubonic Plague, some areas of Europe attempted to improve sanitation by outlawing the practice of discarding waste on public streets. However, widespread installation of underground sewerage systems in European cities did not occur until the early 19th century.

In 1596, the first flushing toilet was invented by Sir John Harrington. He made one for himself and one for his godmother Queen Elizabeth. These were the only two ever produced. After Sir John published a book describing his invention, he was mocked into retirement for his foolish creation. It took almost 200 years before anyone else attempted to create a flushing toilet. In 1775 and 1777, Alexander Cummings and Samuel Prosser each made strides in the reemergence of the water closet.

In 1885, a revolution in toilet making occurred: Thomas Twyford created the first valveless toilet made of china. Until then, water closets were more commonly made of metal and wood. It is widely reported that Thomas Crapper invented the toilet. Not true. He did own a plumbing supply store in England and bought the rights to a patent for a “Silent Valveless Water Waste Preventer,” but he should not be credited with inventing the toilet.

Up until the 1800s in the US, most water pipes were made of hollowed trees. Cast iron pipe imported from England had one of its first installations in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. By the early 1800s, cast iron production began domestically in New Jersey. In 1848, the National Public Health Act was passed creating a plumbing code for the US.

Almost simultaneously in 1883, both the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company (now American Standard) and Kohler began the process of enameling cast iron bathtubs to form a smooth interior surface. Kohler’s first clawfoot tub was advertised as a “horse trough/hog scalder, when furnished with four legs will serve as a bathtub.” These tubs soon became mass-produced as they were recognized as having an extremely sanitary surface that was easy to clean, thus preventing the spread of bacteria and diseases.

Many media sources publish as fact a completely false account of bathing and bathtub history written by H.L. Mencken in 1917. In his story titled, “A Neglected Anniversary,” Mencken writes of laws prohibiting bathing, the first bathtub in America, and the first installation of a bathtub in the White House by Millard Fillmore. He wrote the article as a light-hearted farce during a time of war. None of it is true, yet it is often quoted in reputable publications.

The end of World War I brought with it a construction boom in the US. Bathrooms were fitted with a toilet, sink, and bathtub – mostly clawfoot bathtubs. But even in 1921, only one percent of homes in the US had indoor plumbing. Outhouses were still the norm in rural America. The Sears catalog, with its uncoated, absorbent pages, was a popular form of toilet paper often found hanging inside the outhouse.

Over time, the once popular clawfoot tub morphed into a built-in tub with apron front. This enclosed style afforded much easier maintenance of the bathroom and with the emergence of colored sanitary ware, more design options for the homeowner. It was Crane Company that introduced colored bathroom fixtures to the US market in 1928.

The trend today, though, is shifting back to the elegant style and luxury of a soaking clawfoot tub. Homeowners are tearing out their dime-a-dozen built-in tubs and replacing them with reproduction roll rim footed tubs. Now available in both the classic cast iron or lighter weight acrylic styles, clawfoot bathtubs are produced in a variety of styles and foot finish options.

'''硬脂蜡烛'''的主要成分是石蜡，临高的石蜡来自于煤焦化联合体。在最近的开发工作中，元老院已经在开发文莱的石油和海南岛的页岩油，相信不久，全澳宋的百姓都能点上更便宜的蜡烛。

'''金属蜡烛台'''主要材质为铜，铁或者锡，在临高不是昂贵的产品。此产品由临高轻工业处设计，委托佛山轻工业小商品生产基地OEM。

'''安全火柴'''，随着技术的完善，南海火柴厂已经可以生产安全火柴，主要成分为红磷和三硫化二锑。

煤油灯的使用一直存在燃爆的隐患，民间相应诞生了贩卖防爆砂的行当。有良心的贩子会告诫购买者，一定要定期清洗煤油灯，在油壶中更换防爆砂。事实上，防爆的关键只是勤清洗煤油灯而已。

'''PS，'''考虑到没有乳胶和塑料，只能用现有工艺来尝试。用丝纤维或者木棉纤维作为墨囊储墨，尾部的弹簧活塞作为吸墨的动力，活塞用软木材质。这个是我拍脑袋的草图，需要工业大佬批评。
